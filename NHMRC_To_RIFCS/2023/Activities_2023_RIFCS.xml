            <description type="full">There are various form of dementia, e.g. Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). AD has been a research focus in the last decade as it is the major form of dementia, while there is far less research progress in VaD and FTD. Our project aims to improve understanding on VaD and FTD, focusing on accurate diagnosis, potential therapeutic targets and modifiable risk factors, with the ultimate goal to improve quality of life of people living with dementia.</description>

Investigators in this project will develop the rationale to link pathways that contribute to dangerous levels of tau protein trash and examine if our candidate therapeutics can block these damaging cascades and thus delay the progression of dementia. A positive outcome for this study will be to identify specific and effective therapies to transition to a phase 1 clinical trial for dementia.</description>

Our recent study with residents from this state found that high blood sugar, high blood pressure and overweight are very common. The development of heart disease and diabetes starts early in life and lifelong patterns of behaviour are well established by early adulthood. Our program will evaluate a lifestyle change program with young people from these communities.</description>

Life skills education programs can enhance young people’s resilience to these stressors, but little is known about how to implement them in resource-constrained setting like slums. We will test two strategies to improve uptake of life skills education in 102 slums in New Delhi and Hyderabad, assess their cost-effectiveness and use the findings to inform policy.</description>

Safe@home model of care will directly address barriers to access and health inequalities. Through augmenting the opportunities for care provision at home and integration with the primary and secondary care, the model of care has the potential to reduce health care utilisation of hospitals and EDs and improve survivorship and quality of life.</description>

            <description type="full">Chronic mental disorders are disabling disorders with high rates of social isolation and loneliness. The Social INClusion focusEd caRE (SIncere) project will develop and test the acceptability of much-needed resources to support mental health services to identify and address social exclusion as part of routine mental healthcare. Addressing social exclusion in care will help improve social and clinical outcomes for people with mental disorders, by providing more holistic and personalised care.</description>

            <description type="full">Loneliness is a significant issue for people accessing drug and alcohol treatment. Re-establishing meaningful social relationships is a core process of recovery. Our team developed Groups for Belonging. It is the first loneliness intervention developed for people accessing alcohol and other drug treatment. We plan to conduct a randomised controlled trial examining the effectiveness of Groups for Belonging for people accessing community-based and residential substance use treatment.</description>
