<description type="full">Every year, nearly 250,000 Australian university students report suicidal thoughts and behaviours, but are reluctant to seek support. We have developed a novel screening tool that accurately identifies students at increased suicide risk, and proactively reach out to offer safety planning and support. Our initial work shows this is associated with a 41.7% reduction in suicidal behaviour one year later. In this project, we will extend this program to support university students across the country.</description>

This electronic data will generate a ‘frailty index’ which could be used by patients, carers, and clinical staff to improve hospital care in Qld hospitals, and Australia-wide.</description>

It's important because it can predict how well someone will do in school and in life. A study in Germany showed that a simple and inexpensive program helped young students with self regulation. In South Australia we will see if a modified version of the program can have similar positive effects on student success and wellbeing.</description>

<description type="full">Autoimmune diseases affect over 1 million Australians and pose a high chronic health burden. This group of diseases are highly heritable and the etiology is complex and largely unknown. My research characterises the gene expression patterns in autoimmune diseases and how disease-causal genes interact in the immunologic network. The outcome will facilitate the development of novel treatments and benefit the personalised medicine by tailoring medical care to an individual's unique genetic makeup.</description>

Gene discoveries in ALS can become important diagnostic tools, help to understand the biology of disease, and lead to development of therapies. I will use sophisticated genomics and computational analysis methods to uncover gene defects in both hereditary and sporadic ALS. I will also use deep clinical and biological profiling to develop predictive models of disease progression and prognosis.</description>

In cancer, the matrix is dramatically altered, typically making tumours more aggressive, as well as affecting drug response. Our lab develops new ways to study the matrix in cancer, uncover and validate exciting new matrix co-targets. Our research program identifies new therapeutic approaches co-targeting the matrix, taking them through pre-clinical validation and into the clinic.</description>

<description type="full">This program will develop interventions to support shared decision making, focusing on common treatments where benefits do not, or hardly, outweigh the harms. It will synthesise prognostic evidence about outcomes with and without treatment. The program will develop co-designed, scalable evidence-based interventions that support clinicians and patients to access this evidence and make informed decisions that maximise patient outcomes, wellbeing, and patient-centred sustainable healthcare.</description>

<description type="full">Breast cancer is a genetic disease, but most research has focused on the 2% of human DNA that contains protein-coding genes. However, the vast majority of DNA outside of these genes (called noncoding DNA) is functional and contains important elements that can promote cancer development. This program will explore how one type of noncoding element, called lncRNAs, promotes breast cancer. A better understanding of lncRNAs in breast cancer will provide new avenues for prevention or treatment.</description>

It is therefore essential to select the best treatment strategy that minimises the risk of irreversible long-term disability. MS is however a variable disease, and not all patients require the same strategy to achieve the best long-term outcome. This research stream aims to personalise treatment decisions by studying in who, how, and when, to use the most potent MS therapies to reduce disability while also minimising risk.</description>

<description type="full">Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are rising globally and widespread antibiotic misuse is leading to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) impacting on treatment and control. My innovative research programme uses molecular and genomic methods to detect AMR in STIs, develop surveillance for AMR in STIs, and find new causes of genital infections, enabling development of accurate diagnostics and precise treatments, that achieve high cure and reduce antibiotic overuse and AMR in STIs globally.</description>

This project will develop adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to target ß-cells. These will be used to a) improve islet transplant outcomes in human islets, b) test ability to prevent type 1 diabetes and c) increase human ß-cell proliferation using mice with human islet transplants. The studies have potential to completely change our approach to treating human diabetes.</description>

AF is associated with increased risk of stroke, heart failure and premature death. It is associated with depression and increases the risk of dementia. The proposed randomised studies will provide new approaches to the routine prevention and treatment of AF and of AF-related complications.</description>

<description type="full">Gonorrhoea is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) with resistance to nearly all the antibiotics used for its treatment globally. The benefits and harms of taking antibiotics to prevent STIs and asymptomatic screening strategies are ambiguous in relation to antibiotic resistance. This research will examine the long-term impact of antibiotic use, trial interventions of reducing screening and co-design resources with clinicians and consumers to decrease antibiotic resistance.</description>

I plan to use widely available cheap interventions - a pneumonia vaccine and the antibiotic azithromycin - targeted to children when they are at their most vulnerable, particularly malnourished children, to reduce child deaths. The work will assess if these interventions combined can multiply the benefit, and will progress discussions towards rollout of the interventions.</description>

<description type="full">When the product of certain genes is not needed, these genes are turned off in a process known as gene repression. Genes are switched off by chromatin modifiers, and the activity of these proteins is influenced by RNA. Previously considered a simple messenger molecule, RNA has emerged as a key player during development and in disease. However, our understanding of how RNA regulates gene repression in vertebrates remains rudimentary. This project aims to determine how RNA affects gene repression.</description>

<description type="full">This program aims to reduce the psychological and physical suffering caused by chronic knee pain in adolescents and young adults. My proposal is the world’s first in: i) identifying those at highest risk of poor outcomes; ii) discovering features that can be changed to improve treatment; iii) determining the benefits of personalised digital care. Findings will help prevent adolescents and young adults with knee pain from burdening the healthcare system and contribute to a healthier population.</description>

<description type="full">The sodium leak channel, NALCN plays a crucial role in controlling how our neurons communicate. When there are mutations in the NALCN gene in humans, serious health issues including delayed growth, intellectual disabilities, and early death can occur. Unfortunately, our knowledge of how to develop drugs to treat these diseases is limited. My research aims to find new chemicals to fix the problems with NALCN in these diseases, with the goal of improving the health of affected individuals.</description>

The insight gained could lead to innovative strategies for the treatment of deadly fungal diseases.</description>

<description type="full">The skin is the largest and only visible organ, and is a protective barrier. Skin infections are itchy, and embarrassing, and when ignored, have deathly consequences including sepsis, rheumatic fever, and bone infections. My research focusses on telling the healthy skin and rheumatic fever prevention stories to healthcare workers and families, through guidelines, hip hop videos, and storybooks in local Aboriginal languages. I also design and lead clinical trials to improve patient outcomes.</description>

Tracking seizure risk enables people with epilepsy to better manage their seizures, improving quality of life and safety. Moving forward, this project will explore how seizure risk relates to stress and multiday rhythms in the autonomic nervous system and will then link risk forecasts to a novel targeted, mobile intervention to reduce the chance of having a seizure.</description>

<description type="full">Immune system T cells that can kill a cancer called large B cell lymphoma can be made in the lab. These engineered cells are known as chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells (CAR-Ts). CAR-Ts have revolutionised lymphoma treatment. However, most patients (~60%) can’t be cured by CAR-Ts. This proposal will study the qualities of CAR-Ts and the factors that block their function in lymphoma tumours. We will then develop new methods to engineer and improve CAR-Ts and test them in clinical trials.</description>

<description type="full">Viral infections represent a significant global health issue and for many viruses, we still don’t have effective therapeutics. We showed that lipid droplets (LDs), produced by the host during viral infection underpin a successful innate immune response. This research program aims to better understand how LDs are secreted and how we can use them to combat viral infections. This will lead to the development of more effective antiviral treatments, relieving the rising burden of infectious diseases.</description>

<description type="full">Systematic reviews capture, and attempt to distil, all available evidence on a given question, and routinely underpin healthcare decision making. However, weaknesses in their quality mean that systematic reviews can mislead patients, health care providers and policy makers, leading to suboptimal care. My program will develop and evaluate novel technologies and tools to improve the quality of systematic reviews of health evidence, hence improving health outcomes.</description>

Interrogating the evasion mechanisms deployed by Coxiella will assist in the development of novel therapeautic strategies.</description>

Here, we will perform detailed studies to understand how the pathway works on the molecular, cellular and organ scale.

Frailty is modifiable, meaning that it can be prevented, reduced or even reversed. This research aims to co-design a digital platform called “The Frailty Hub” that contains education modules, resources, and goal-setting activities. It is expected that the Frailty Hub will improve consumers’ knowledge of frailty and provide them with the skills and resources to prevent and manage frailty.</description>

This research will reveal if this new circuit is a viable target for drug development to treat methamphetamine addiction.</description>

<description type="full">Children with burns require special, often complex treatments within 24 hours of injury to effectively reduce the impact of injury and minimise chronic physical and emotional scars. Unfortunately, treatments are often not implemented (e.g. first aid), are too complex (emerging technologies), or patients are too far away (e.g. in regional and remote areas of Australia). My research aims to test simple new technologies to make sure every child, no matter where they live, gets the best care.</description>

This research aims to identify the different organelles within brain cells that become dysfunctional before and after a diagnosis of frontotemporal and Lewy body dementias (more lethal than Alzheimer’s intself) and Parkinson's disease. Analysis of samples from brain donors at different disease stages will determine which organelles are affected before obvious pathology to indicate new treatment opportunities.</description>

Whilst overall survival rates are good for NHL, there are features of certain NHL cancers that are associated with poor therapy responses and poor patient outcomes. I will use innovative pre-clinical models and methodologies to investigate how three poor prognostic features contribute to therapy resistance. Using this information, I will test new anti-cancer therapies that could improve patient survival rates.</description>

<description type="full">This program of work aims to reduce the global burden of death and disability due to asthma, which is largely preventable. It will provide evidence for a simple new way of diagnosing and treating asthma. The new therapy both relieves patients’ symptoms and reduces the risk of severe asthma attacks. The research aims to improve how we assess asthma and respond to patients’ treatment needs, with good quality innovations that are valued by patients and easy to implement in a range of countries.</description>

<description type="full">Melanoma and skin cancer diagnoses place a heavy physical, emotional, and financial toll on many Australians and their families. This program of research will provide the evidence for how Australia can move toward a targeted melanoma screening program for those at highest risk, and improve the reach and relevance of personalised skin cancer prevention. Together this will lead to a significant reduction in melanoma incidence, morbidity and mortality.</description>

Kidney failure is a common and serious complication of vasodilatory shock that is highly burdensome to patients. This research program will test whether a new medication (‘angiotensin II’) improves kidney outcomes in patients with vasodilatory shock. Its findings could change management globally, transforming the lives of this highly vulnerable patient group.</description>

Specifically, tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) in organs rapidly protect against infection &amp; cancer but may contribute to autoimmunity. Here, I will explore TRM diversity &amp; molecular cues that govern their behaviour in disease-specific contexts to uncover novel pathways that can precisely target ‘pathogenic’ TRM while preserving ‘protective’ TRM.</description>

<description type="full">Despite therapeutic advances, the global cancer burden is steadily rising, with 1 in 5 men and 1 in 6 women developing cancer in their lifetime. This makes cancer one of the leading causes of death worldwide. There is a clinical need to identify patients at early-stage risk of cancer metastases or progression. To achieve this, this project aims to develop a technology for cancer detection from the blood that is highly accurate and can be implemented in routine screening.</description>

<description type="full">Brain injury is common in infants born preterm, leading to serious, life-long neurodevelopmental problems with no cure currently available. My vision is the implementation of personalised and “brain-oriented” care. I have previously identified how preterm birth leads to low brain oxygen supply and brain injury. Now, my goals are to detect brain injury early in preterm infants and to personalise their hospital treatment, to reduce further brain injury and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.</description>

Although opioids are commonly used to treat pain before and after hip or knee replacement, inappropriate use has been associated with inappropriate persistent opioid use, opioid-related harms and poorer post-operative pain and functional outcomes. This research program will identify the effectiveness of interventions to reduce persistent opioid use after patients undergo hip and knee replacements.</description>

<description type="full">This project aims to identify the timepoint at which ALS-FTD begins. Previous work has already shown that behavioural and cognitive changes are the first signs of disease and will prove a useful target for drug trials where the aim is to stop the disease as early as possible. This project will leverage national links to develop a cohort of pre-symptomatic gene carriers that initially will be observed over time and will subsequently form a base for recruitment into clinical trials.</description>

<description type="full">Malaria is a major disease of humans that kills &gt;630,000 people each year. The treatment and control of malaria is being threatened by the ability of the infectious agent to develop resistance to current antimalarials. Overall, this program will develop new antimalarials with a high barrier for resistance and provide novel insights into the fundamental biology of ubiquitin in P. falciparum and adapt this knowledge for new therapies that mitigate emergence of drug resistance in malaria.</description>

The bacteria that cause these diseases are genetically closely related which provides an ideal opportunity to target them with one vaccine. My research aims to establish an effective, safe and cost-effective immunisation program to protect against these diseases. By working with young people, we will co-design approaches to increase vaccine uptake for optimal protection against these 2 devastating diseases.</description>

<description type="full">TNF is a very potent inflammatory cytokine and causes many inflammatory diseases, like psoriasis, IBD and rheumatoid arthritis. TNF can also kill cells. However, TNF signalling is complex and the link between cell death and inflammation is still unclear. Our aim is to discover how cellular and environmental context affects TNF signalling outcomes. We believe this will allow us to reduce TNF mediated inflammation or enhance TNF killing of cancer cells therapeutically.</description>

<description type="full">Diets are the lead cause of chronic disease. My research will work with Indigenous storeowners and retailers to translate new evidence into healthy food actions in stores and define systems and policy to ensure these are implemented in all 220 remote Australian stores. I will investigate how this approach could apply in international Indigenous retail. Healthy food actions will lead to the creation of stores that support consumers make healthier purchases and reduce burden of disease disparity.</description>

These specialty areas will act as examples for others to follow. The result will be an increase in surgical trials in Australia.</description>

<description type="full">Cutting-edge long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies provide a more complete picture of the human genome than previously possible. There are countless opportunities to streamline, improve or reimagine disease diagnosis using LRS. I will develop a collaborative research program that will lead LRS innovation and impact in Australia. My program will deliver new knowledge, resources and tools for genomic medicine, and support the biomedical community with access to the latest LRS advances.</description>

The more convenient 3 weeks of RT is as safe and effective as 5 weeks of RT.

<description type="full">Ischaemic stroke is due to clot blocking vessels of the brain. Thrombectomy or mechanical removal of clot is the best treatment for clot obstructing large vessel compared to clot busting drug or best medical therapy. However, the best treatment (clot busting or extraction) of clot obstructing medium sized vessel is yet to be determined. The aim of this trial is to determine the best treatment strategy for blood clot blocking medium sized vessels of the brain.</description>

The purpose of this trial is to determine whether giving the same dose of a chemotherapy combination called BEP, Bleomycin, Etoposide Cisplatin, on a 2-weekly schedule will be more effective than a 3-weekly schedule. This Australian led international trial could improve cure rates and reduce the duration of side effects.</description>

<description type="full">Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections causes 300,000 deaths per year. The SNAP trial is an Australian led international clinical trial addressing priority treatment questions. Despite delays in starting SNAP due to the COVID-19 pandemic, SNAP is now the largest S. aureus bloodstream infection trial ever. Through ongoing funding, we aim to involve more countries, ensure sufficient participants to address current and new questions, and understand long-term patient impacts of the infection.</description>

<description type="full">My research aims to understand why the same virus causes mild infections in one person and has devastating-outcomes in another. 1-in-5 people have weak immunity resulting in severe infections. Traditional vaccines boost healthy immunity rather than repair immune function, providing suboptimal protection in high-risk populations. Understanding how immunity is generated, why it fails and how immunity can be repaired will aid development of novel vaccines/interventions for high-risk populations.</description>

Working closely with Indigenous communities the project will explore Indigenous views on the commercial determinants of health (CDoH); evaluate the effectiveness of existing marketing regulations; assess how specific commercial entities affect Indigenous health, and collaborate with Indigenous organisations to co-create solutions to the CDoH. The key outcome will be an Indigenous-led CDoH policy agenda.</description>

Scaled-up, this approach could be adopted by other industries and contexts in Australia.</description>

<description type="full">Each year in Australia more than 9,000 pregnancies are impacted by pre-eclampsia, 27,000 babies are born preterm and 2,200 babies are stillborn. Many of these outcomes are preventable. Our initiative will implement a digital medical device developed with significant consumer and clinician engagement to provide pregnant women with personalised risk assessment, enabling effective care. Adoption of this device will dramatically improve outcomes, reduce variation in care and reduce healthcare costs.</description>

<description type="full">One part of the human immune system is hardwired and innate, responding immediately to invading pathogens. This requires a system of sensors that detect pathogens or the damage that pathogens cause to the host. Unfortunately, gene alterations can lead to increased activation of these pathways causing autoinflammatory diseases. In this Centre, we learn from these gene variants how our innate immune system works, and how to target these inflammatory pathways to prevent disease.</description>

<description type="full">Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease that causes inflammation in the brain. People with MS need treatments that will protect and repair the brain. In our MS Centre, people with MS, researchers, and doctors work together to find out how MS affects the brain. This gives us clues about the type/s of drugs that might help. We grow brain cells in the lab, add the potential drugs, and measure the effect. Drugs that protect brain cells are then tested in the clinic to see how they help people with MS.</description>

In this Centre, we will study how and what the sensors are detecting, if this can be modified, how the sensors co-ordinate a response and apply this knowledge to provide treatment strategies for a range of auto-inflammatory diseases.</description>

<description type="full">Meningococcal disease and gonorrhoea are two serious diseases in young people that are genetically similar. Our research has shown the meningococcal vaccine may protect against gonorrhoea. Our Centre of Research Excellence aims to extend this work, uniting national and international experts, to translate the best immunisation program to prevent both diseases with one vaccine. This is expected to significantly drive down cases of meningococcal disease and gonorrhoea in Australia and globally.</description>

Our vision is to transform the treatment of DCM by targeting molecular pathways that are predictive of patient outcomes, so that the right treatment can be tailored to the right patient.</description>

To achieve this, we have assembled a research team of experts in the biology and treatment of these tumours and will build upon our exciting preliminary discoveries for enhancing the activity of these drugs to improve patient outcomes.</description>
